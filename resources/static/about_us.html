        <h2>About the team FutureCurves</h2>
        <p style="margin: 10px;">FutureCurves focuses on the mental well-being of people in isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak. It offers
        wholesome daily tasks for the users to finish, while getting points for redeeming coupons. An abundance of
        minigames to play is also a feature in our project.
        </p>

        We first came up with the idea of having such an app to cheer people up when we found most of our peers are
        feeling down in the isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also we are concerned about the affected economy
        as well, so we think of a win-win mechanism of helping both the users as well as businesses.

            “It’s time to meditate in solitude.” That’s what I thought when the “stay-at-home” order came into effect.
            You know for a guy that likes getting close to nature, it’s a totally different lifestyle to experience for
            the coming months, but I will know how to get along, and that’s why he’s leading such a project.

        The <b>"Web developer"</b> in FutureCurves.
        Very interested in MongoDB and using that in a “web app” project.
        I have always been feeling down during the isolation time so thought this is a good time to start working on a
        project that helps people like me.
        Stay positive everyone!

        "There's a reason we don't see the world in black and white." by Celerie Kemble.

        In my Hometown there would be nothing but sand, dirt and rocks for miles and miles on although it looked like
        just a normal small old Communist mining town. From a young age i spent my time with my grandma in the
        countryside, my grandma at the time had a variety of animals from sheep, goat, to horses and cows. I spent my
        time in the open air that is what i'm most content with, however the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has made
        going outside dangerous. so having an app that helps people with isolation and deppression became my goal.
